## Flask Login and Logout System

This repository provides a simple implementation of a user login and logout system using Flask, a Python web framework. The purpose of this system is to demonstrate how to create a basic authentication system for web applications using Flask's built-in capabilities.

### Features

- User registration: New users can sign up with their email and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- User authentication: Implements a secure session-based authentication system.
- User logout: Allows authenticated users to log out securely.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-login-logout.git
   cd flask-login-logout
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   ```
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. Run the application:

   flask run
   ```

6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
